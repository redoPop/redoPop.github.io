This entry exists because you've got to start somewhere. ðŸ˜Š

I've built a mess of [drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and [notes](https://bear.app/) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/) and [journals](https://dayoneapp.com/) over the years: private, unpolished half-thoughts in plain text. Every now and then I hit on something I think might be worth sharing, but I'm not sure where. I've never been good about maintaining a blog, which somehow makes it hard to start.

This won't be a blog, then. It'll just be a place to post some of the things I've written. A sort of log, but on the web.

You can follow [the feed](/feed.atom) if you like.
